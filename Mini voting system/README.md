Certainly, let's go through the provided C code line by line, explaining each part:

```c
#include<stdio.h>
```

- This line includes the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`). It's a standard C library used for input and output operations, including functions like `printf` and `scanf`.

```c
void displayMenu()
{
    printf("\n-- Voting System Menu --\n");
    printf("\n1. Cast Vote\n");
    printf("2. Display Results\n");
    printf("3. Exit\n");
    printf("------------------------\n");
}
```

- This section defines a function named `displayMenu()`. This function is responsible for displaying the menu options for the voting system.

```c
int main()
{
    int candidate1Votes = 0;
    int candidate2votes = 0;
    int candidate3votes = 0;
    int totalVotes = 0;
    int choice;
```

- In the `main` function, several integer variables are declared and initialized:
   - `candidate1Votes`, `candidate2Votes`, and `candidate3Votes` store the number of votes each candidate has received. They are initially set to 0.
   - `totalVotes` keeps track of the total number of votes cast.
   - `choice` is used to store the user's menu choice.

```c
do{
    displayMenu();
    printf("Enter your choice: ");
    scanf("%d",&choice);
```

- The `do` keyword marks the beginning of a do-while loop. The loop will repeatedly execute the code within the block until the condition in the `while` statement is false.

- `displayMenu();` calls the `displayMenu()` function to show the voting system menu options.

- `printf("Enter your choice: ");` displays a prompt for the user to enter their choice.

- `scanf("%d",&choice);` reads the user's input as an integer and stores it in the `choice` variable.

```c
switch(choice){
    case 1:
        printf("\n-- Cast Vote --\n");
        printf("1. Candidate 1\n");
        printf("2. Candidate 2\n");
        printf("3. Candidate 3\n");
        printf("---------------------\n");
        int candidateNumber;
        scanf("%d", &candidateNumber);
```

- The `switch` statement is used to determine the action to take based on the value of `choice`.

- When `choice` is 1, the program enters the "Cast Vote" case. It displays a sub-menu where the user can choose a candidate (Candidate 1, Candidate 2, or Candidate 3).

- `int candidateNumber;` declares an integer variable to store the user's choice of candidate number.

- `scanf("%d", &candidateNumber);` reads the user's input as an integer and stores it in the `candidateNumber` variable.

```c
        switch(candidateNumber){
            case 1:
                candidate1Votes++;
                break;
            case 2:
                candidate2votes++;
                break;
            case 3:
                candidate3votes++;
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid candidate number!\n");
                break;
        }
```

- Inside the nested `switch` statement, the program determines which candidate the user voted for based on `candidateNumber`.

- If the user chooses Candidate 1 (case 1), `candidate1Votes` is incremented by 1.

- If the user chooses Candidate 2 (case 2), `candidate2Votes` is incremented by 1.

- If the user chooses Candidate 3 (case 3), `candidate3Votes` is incremented by 1.

- If the user enters an invalid candidate number, a message is displayed: "Invalid candidate number!"

```c
        totalVotes++;
        printf("Vote cast successfully!\n");
        break;
    case 2:
        printf("\n--- Voting Results ---\n");
        printf("Candidate 1: %d votes\n",candidate1Votes);
        printf("Candidate 2: %d votes\n",candidate2votes);
        printf("Candidate 3: %d votes\n",candidate3votes);
        printf("Total votes: %d\n",totalVotes);
        printf("-----------------------\n");
        break;
    case 3:
        printf("Exiting the program...\n");
        break;
    default:
        printf("Invalid choice! Please try again.\n");
        break;
}
```

- The `switch` statement continues with other cases based on the user's `choice`:
   - Case 2: It displays the voting results, showing the number of votes each candidate received and the total votes cast.
   - Case 3: It displays a message indicating that the program is exiting.
   - Default: If the user enters an invalid choice, it displays a message: "Invalid choice! Please try again."

```c
} while(choice !=3);
return 0;
```

- The `do-while` loop continues to execute as long as the value of `choice` is not equal to 3 (the "Exit" option). This loop structure allows the user to repeatedly make choices from the menu until they choose to exit.

- Once the user selects the "Exit" option, the loop exits, and the program returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

Overall, this code represents a simple text-based voting system where users can cast votes for candidates and view voting results. It is a basic example and can be enhanced with additional features like candidate names, error handling, and data persistence for more practical use.
